Oranges are one of America's staple fruits. [Orange juice is the most popular fruit juice in America by a large margin.](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/chart-gallery/gallery/chart-detail/?chartId=85485) They're very, very juicy.

They are also very sweet. They rely on their high levels of sugar to mask a slight underlying bitter flavor. [This is why toothpaste makes them taste terrible. It lessens your ability to taste sweet things.](https://sites.psu.edu/siowfa16/2016/10/16/why-are-orange-juice-and-toothpaste-such-a-bad-mix/) They also grow on trees and are obviously eaten raw, though peeled. They are one of the furthest fruits from a vegetable.

"Orange" is also the name of a popular, common color. However [this color was actually named after the fruit.](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/orange-fruit-color-origin) The fruit itself is the original "orange", and its name comes from the ancient Sanskrit word "<span lang="sa">नारङ्ग</span>" – "nāraṅga". Oranges are truly one of the classic fruits.
