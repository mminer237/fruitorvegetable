Oranges are one of America's staple fruits. [Orange juice is the most popular fruit juice in America by a large margin.](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/chart-gallery/gallery/chart-detail/?chartId=85485) They're such popular fruits, they literally had a color named after them. They are also very sweet. They are one of the furthest fruits from a vegetable.
