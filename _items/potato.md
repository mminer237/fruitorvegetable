Ah, potatoes—one of the greatest vegetables ever. Boil 'em, mash 'em, stick 'em in a stew—their deliciousness is matched only by their versatility.

They are clearly vegetables though. They have eyes, not seeds, and are thus not even [fruits]({% link _types/fruit.html %}) botanically. They are not sweet at all. They are super starchy. You eat them as part of your main meal, not dessert. You always cook them before eating them. They're vegetables through and through.
