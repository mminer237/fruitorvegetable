Yams are a type of tuber that people eat. They're not [fruits]({% link _types/fruit.html %}) thoughâ€”yams don't contain seeds. They are tubers and therefore vegetables.

Note that yams are different than [sweet potatoes]({% link _items/sweet-potato.md %}). They come from two entirely different plants. Sweet potatoes are still vegetables, but they are [tuberous roots]({% link _types/tuberous-root.html %}), not actually tubers which come from the stem. It is unlikely that most Americans have actually eaten a true yam. They're mostly only grown in Africa and are much closer to [regular potatoes]({% link _items/potato.md %}).
