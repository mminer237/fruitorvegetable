Zucchinis are very similar to [cucumbers](% link _items/cucumber.md %}). While they taste a bit different, they are both long green fruits. The zucchini just has stemmy bit on the end. It is actually a type of [[squash]({% link _items/squash.md %})].

Zucchinis are only "fruits" in the botanical sense of being the fruit of the plant however. Zucchini is a botanical fruit because it is formed from the ovary of the zucchini plant. Even more specifically, it is a [pepo]({% link _types/pepo.html %}), a type of botanical [berry]({% link _types/berry.html %})! This is again only a scientific classification [that is irrelevant to the ordinary person]({% link _pages/you-dont-have-to-care-about-botanical-definitions.html %}). It just means that it was formed from a single ovary and has a wholly fleshy wall. If you include zucchinis in your berry mix, you are weird and should stop it.

<span class="speakable">For practical purposes zucchinis are vegetables.</span> Despite the name of their botanical classification, they are a vegetable culinarily and not a fruit or berry. They have a "vegetably" flavor and are not sweet. They are not eaten in fruit salads; they are eaten in regular salad or savory dishes, often cooked. These are hallmarks of being a vegetable.
