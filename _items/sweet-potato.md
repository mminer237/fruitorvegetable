Sweet potatoes are the main, tuberous roots of sweet potato plants that people eat. Although they are made into pies, they're colorful, and they are fairly sweet, they're still not [fruits]({% link _types/fruit.html %}). Something has to be a fruit botanically for it to be one culinarily, and sweet potatoes don't contain seeds. They are roots and therefore vegetables.

Interestingly, they are also not usually considered to actually be [tubers]({% link _types/tuber.html %}) like [potatoes]({% link _items/potato.md %}) and [yams]({% link _items/yam.md %}) (yes, they are different) are. This is because of the fact that sweet potatoes are roots, not part of the stem. Again though, none of them are fruits. They're all vegetables.
