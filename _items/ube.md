The purple yam, commonly known as <span lang="tl">ube</span>, is a type of [yam]({% link _items/yam.md %}) commonly eaten as a dessert ingredient in Filipino cuisine. They make ube cake, ube donuts, ube cheesecake, ube donuts, and even [ube ice cream](https://news.baskinrobbins.com/blog/story-behind-ube-coconut-swirl):
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">There&#39;s something about our new Ube Coconut Swirl on a Friday &gt;&gt;&gt; 💜🥥🍥 <a href="https://t.co/ToTPBmHnKh">pic.twitter.com/ToTPBmHnKh</a></p>&mdash; Baskin-Robbins (@BaskinRobbins) <a href="https://twitter.com/BaskinRobbins/status/1515057373810810881?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 15, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

This is odd since, being a yam, it is a type of [tuber]({% link _types/tuber.html %}), not a [fruit]({% link _types/fruit.html %}). This is the botanical definition of fruit based on the fact that ube do not contain seeds. Instead, they grow underground and just store nutrients.

However, part of being a culinary fruit is still that something is the botanical "fruit" of the plant, so <span class="speakable">ube are vegetables even though they are used in desserts</span>. Being used in sweet dishes is normally one of the hallmarks of being a fruit, but it's not a definitive test. [Sweet potatoes]({% link _items/sweet-potato.md %}) and [pumpkins]({% link _items/pumpkin.md %}) are other good examples of vegetables commonly being used in desserts. The other aspects of being a fruit like juiciness, sweetness, and such must also be considered. You would never grab a raw yam and bite into it for a snack.

Purple yams, like all yams are very starchy and not juicy. Ube are a bit sweeter than other yams, but still not like a fruit would be. And again, ube grow underground; they're not botanical fruits even. These show that despite their use in desserts, they're still considered a vegetable.
