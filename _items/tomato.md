Ah, tomatoes. [This is the most asked-about plant by a large margin.](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&q=is%20corn%20a%20fruit%20or%20a%20vegetable,is%20a%20tomato%20a%20fruit%20or%20a%20vegetable,is%20a%20pumpkin%20a%20fruit%20or%20a%20vegetable,is%20a%20cucumber%20a%20fruit%20or%20a%20vegetable,is%20an%20avocado%20a%20fruit%20or%20a%20vegetable) It seems everyone is confused about whether a tomato is a fruit or a vegetable.

It is often said that a tomato is technically a fruit and that people calling it a vegetable are repeating uneducated beliefs. However, these people themselves tend to just be parroting what they have heard. Botanically, a tomato is the fruit of the plant, however this does not make it wrong to call it a vegetable.

If you had not heard of this debate and were eating tomatoes for the first time, you would intuitively think that it is a vegetable. It's not that sweet; it's more savory. It doesn't grow on a tree. It grows on a short, annual plant. They're often cooked into a sauce or alongside other savory foods, and never eaten raw like an [apple]({% link _items/apple.md %}). You put it in a regular salad with other vegetables, not a fruit salad. Doesn't that make it a vegetable? *Yes, it does.* In fact, [studies show that 70â€“78% percent of people recognize tomatoes as vegetables.](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/4160B03E914086279B19D2207D5E0691/S136898001000368Xa.pdf/div-class-title-the-meaning-of-fruits-and-vegetables-div.pdf#page=4) As the purpose of language is to communicate, "vegetable" is clearly the preferred word to convey the attributes of a tomato.

This doesn't conflict with its botanical definition. A tomato is both a fruit *and* a vegetable, at least in some sense of the words. It just depends on the context. Technically, it's a berry even.

However, it is a berry only by virtue of the obscure botanical definition of "berry," meaning it came from an ovary, is fleshy, and doesn't split open to spread its seeds. [This has no relevance for 99% of people.]({% link _pages/you-dont-have-to-care-about-botanical-definitions.html %}) The botanical definition does not have any influence in the world of food. Unless you are a scientist studying plants, the botanical definitions of "fruit" and berry" are useless for you. You are eating tomatoes, not growing them. A tomato is a vegetable.

If you call tomatoes fruits just because they are the seed-bearing part of the tomato plant, there are [many other vegetables you would have to miscategorize under such logic]({% link _pages/confusing-items.html %}). [Cucumbers]({% link _items/cucumber.md %}), [olives]({% link _items/olive.md %}), [pumpkins]({% link _items/pumpkin.md %}), [corn]({% link _items/corn.md %}), and many more vegetables all comprise the fruit of plants. But to call such things fruits would make the word "fruit" lose a large part of its meaning. Fruit has a culinary meaning too, like "vegetable" is a culinary term. Mixing botanical and culinary terms does not make sense. It just confuses people, which is the opposite of what language is supposed to do.
