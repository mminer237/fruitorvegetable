Sweet corn is probably what most people think of as "[corn]({% link _items/corn.md %})." It is a very small percentage of the corn you see growing, but it's the only corn that you will ever eat whole. For being a vegetable, it is very versatile. You can eat it as loose corn, corn-on-the-cob, creamed corn, scalloped corn, corn fritters, corn chowder, corn pudding, etc. And they're all delicious.

What is it? Well, each individual kernel is its own fruit, the cob is very nearly a separate fruit, and sweet corn is a vegetable. This fits since you eat sweet corn whole like in chili or scalloped corn or Taco Bell. It is called sweet corn because it is sweet, but it is not culinarily a fruit. That would just be too weird. It's not *that* sweet.

Sweet corn's vegetabliness contrasts with [dent corn]({% link _items/dent-corn.md %})'s graininess.
