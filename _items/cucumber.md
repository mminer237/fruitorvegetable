Yes, cucumbers are botanically a fruit. While they are probably one of the last plants that we would think of as a "berry," that is what they are botanically because they have seeds inside them, are fleshy, were made from a single ovary, and don't split open to spread their seeds everywhere.

In the culinary world, they are obviously vegetables. If you put cucumbers in your berry pies, you should probably be committed.
