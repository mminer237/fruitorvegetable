Lemons are classic fruits. They are very often added to drinks for flavoring. [Although they are not very sweet]({% link _pages/sugar-content-table.html %}), they are *very* sour. They are colorful and look just like the rest of the [citrus fruits]({% link _types/hesperidium.html %}). Clearly the lemon not a vegetable.
