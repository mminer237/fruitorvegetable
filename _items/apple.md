Apples are *the* stereotypical fruit. They sell like five types of them along with all the other fruits. They're sweet. They're the most American flavor of pie. [They're commonly incorrectly shown as the forbidden fruit of the Bible.](https://answersingenesis.org/bible-characters/adam-and-eve/was-the-forbidden-fruit-an-apple/) They're what every kid learns 'A' stands for. One of the world's most valuable companies is named after them and has a logo of one with a bit taken out of it. [They literally have a whole type of fruits named after them.]({% link _types/pome.html %})

Unless you are from some backwater desert wasteland where you have never seen or heard of an apple, you *really* should know that it is a fruit.
