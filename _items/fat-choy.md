Fat choy is an ingredient in some Chinese cuisine comprising a dried <span lang="la">Nostoc</span> bacterial colony. <span lang="la">Nostoc</span> colonies form a jelly-like substance to help them survive in the range of environments they live in. This dark green gel is then harvested (often illegally), dried, and cooked. The resulting product looks essentially like black hair. Even though it is the remnants of bacteria, it is considered a vegetable in Chinese cuisine, and its Chinese name <span lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">fàcài</span> literally means "hair vegetable".

This vegetable has essentially no nutritional or medicinal value, but has nonetheless been eaten for centuries as a noodle substitute. It is traditionally eaten on Chinese New Year, as its name sounds like much like <span lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">fācái</span>, which means "get rich" and is part of a common New Year's greeting.
