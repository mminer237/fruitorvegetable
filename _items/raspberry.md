Raspberries are obviously fruits. They're very sweet, they're a common candy flavor (even if ascribed a false color), they're always eaten raw and/or in a dessert, they're colorful, they spoil quickly, they grow on bushes, and they're botanically fruits. There's nothing vegetably about them.

They're actually not botanically berries though. They're actually an aggregate fruit where each individual "drupelet" would actually be a separate fruit. These fruits would be [drupes]({% link _types/drupe.html %}) though, still not botanical berries. Yet, [cucumbers]({% link _items/cucumber.md %}) are botanical berries. This evidences how [you shouldn't care about botanical definitions.]({% link _pages/you-dont-have-to-care-about-botanical-definitions.html %})

They're distinguished from [blackberries]({% link _items/blackberry.md %}) by being red, smaller, sweeter, and by the raspberry coming off of the middle receptacle that normally fills it on the plant, making the raspberries hollow. Interestingly, blackberries don't do that.
