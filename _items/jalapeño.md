Jalapeños are one of the most popular types of chili peppers. They have a medium amount of heat and a good flavor that works well in many dishes.

Botanically, jalapeños are berries and the ["fruit" of the plant]({% link _types/fruit.html %}#botanically). However, jalapeños are neither fruit nor berries for practical, culinary purposes. They are vegetables.

Although some varieties of jalapeños have low amounts of capsaicin, this is atypical, and jalapeños are still never sweet and fruit-like. They are not something normal people would pop raw in their mouths for a snack like an actual culinary berry. Jalapeños are typically used in burritos, nachos, poppers, subs, and salsas but not in desserts. They're an addition to savory dishes. They have heat, not sweet.
