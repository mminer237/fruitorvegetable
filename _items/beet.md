Beets are the main roots of beet plants that people eat. They're pretty round and really colorful, but they're not [fruits]({% link _types/fruit.html %}) at all. Something has to be a fruit botanically for it to be one culinarily, and beets don't contain seeds. Plus, it's often either cooked or eaten in a vegetable salad. I would never bit into one raw or put any in a fruit salad.
