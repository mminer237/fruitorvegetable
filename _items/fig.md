Figs are fruits. This is obvious from their sweetness. [They're *the sweetest* fruits, in fact, with over double the sugar of any vegetable.]({% link _pages/sugar-content-table.html %})

Honestly, I've only ever had figs in these cookies:

However, only eating things in cookies is pretty indicative of that thing being a fruit culinarily. Other than Fig Newtons, they're usually eaten raw or in jams, which is what you would expect for a fruit.

Botanically, figs are *weird*. They are fruits, but they are [multiple fruits]({% link _types/multiple-fruit.html %}) because they actually start out as many separate flowers, which then create many separate [drupes]({% link _types/drupe.html %}), which then all merge together to create a new single fruit. Even if you have seen a whole fig, you might not have imagined this. That's because these fruits—as I understand it—grow inside a stem, inwards and towards each other. The whole "fruit" that we pick and eat is actually part of the stem called a syconium which contains this multiple fruit. Because the stem itself is fleshy and part of the "fruit," figs are also [accessory fruits]({% link _types/accessory-fruit.html %}).

Of course, unless you are a botanist, you probably have no more than a passing interest in any of this technical rigor. This demonstrates how botanical definitions are pretty useless for ordinary people. Figs are fruits in general because they're sweet plant bits.
