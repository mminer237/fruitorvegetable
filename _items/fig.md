Figs are fruits. They're pretty sweet. I've honestly only ever had them in cookies, but that's pretty indicative of being a fruit culinarily. I think they're usually eaten raw or in jams otherwise, which is like a fruit.

Botanically, figs are *weird*. They are fruits, but they are [mulitple fruits]({% link _types/multiple-fruit.html %}) because they actually start out as many separate flowers, which then create many separate [drupes]({% link _types/drupe.html %}), which then all merge together to create a new single fruit. Even if you have seen a whole fig, you might not have imagined this. That's because these fruits—as I understand it—grow inside a stem, inwards and towards each other. The whole "fruit" that we pick and eat is actually part of the stem called a syconium which contains this multiple fruit. Because the stem itself is fleshy and part of the "fruit," figs are also [accessory fruits]({% link _types/accessory-fruit.html %}).

Of course, unless you are a botanist, you probably have no more than a passing interest in any of this technical rigor. This demonstrates how botanical definitions are pretty useless for ordinary people. Figs are fruits in general because they're sweet plant bits.
