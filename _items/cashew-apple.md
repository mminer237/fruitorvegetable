Cashew apples are the little-known counterpart to the [cashew nut]({% link _items/cashew.md %}). Actually the "nut" is the botanical fruit, and the "apple" is just an accessory fruit. Technically, the cashew apple is not even a botanical fruit, since the cashew nut contains the seed.

Cashew apples are rarely eaten outside of placed where cashews are produced because the fruits are delicate, easily bruised, and have a very short shelf life. They are definitely culinary fruits though, as they are quite sweet and juicy, if astringent.
