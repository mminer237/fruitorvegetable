Salmonberries are fruits that are very similar to [raspberries]({% link _items/raspberry.md %}). The flavor is admittedly more bland, but they are still a bit sweet, juicy, and always eaten raw or in a dessert. They're still colorful, though they tend more towards orange where raspberries tend more towards purple. Everything about salmonberries still point to them being fruits, not vegetables. They spoil quickly, they grow on bushes, and they're botanically fruits.

Like raspberries, they're not botanically berries, instead being aggregate fruits where each individual "drupelet" would actually be a separate fruit. Yet again, [the botanical definition doesn't matter.]({% link _pages/you-dont-have-to-care-about-botanical-definitions.html %})

Also like raspberries, they're distinguished from [blackberries]({% link _items/blackberry.md %}) by the salmonberry coming off of the middle receptacle that normally fills it on the plant, making the fruit hollow, which blackberries don't do.
