Peaches are classic fruits. They are more specifically the most common [drupe]({% link _types/drupe.html %}) botanically. (I.e., they have a stone/pit.)

They are very obviously a fruit. They're sweet and delicious for dessert. You make delicious pies from them. You would store them in syrup to save their deliciousness for later. You might put them in a fruit salad to make it more delicious. (If you haven't gathered, they're delicious; and if you haven't tried one, you're living life wrong. If you have tried one, you know it definitely isn't a [vegetable]({% link _types/vegetable.html %}).)
