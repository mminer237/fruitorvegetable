Kiwis are brown fuzzy fruits that are obviously fruits. They're very sweet, they're eaten raw, and they're botanically fruits. They're also even called kiwifruits in Australasia.

Botanically, they're specifically berries since they are all fleshy and don't have divisions in them. Most people would not ordinarily consider them to be berries though. They're just fruit. Interestingly however, there is a type of type of kiwis called kiwi berries. As you can guess, these would be berries. This is because they are much smaller (berry-sized) and don't have the fuzzy skin. Although you can eat the fuzzy skin, standard kiwis are usually peeled, which goes against the whole thing with berries where you can just keep popping them in your mouth.
