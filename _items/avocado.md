Avocados are definitely fruits botanically. They are the ripened ovaries of the avocado tree and contain seeds. Interestingly, they are technically a <a href="{% link _types/berry.html %}">berry</a> instead of a <a href="{% link _types/drupe.html %}">drupe</a> because there is a *very* thin endocarp (third layer of fruit) around the stone. [This has no practical effect for you.]({% link _pages/you-dont-have-to-care-about-botanical-definitions.html %})

Culinarily, they're...well...I'm honestly not sure. I would personally think of them more as a vegetable because they're not sweet and they're more substantive. I would never eat an avocado for a fruity snack. They're high in fat, not sugar.

However, this view isn't unanimous. Apparently some people do eat them as a fruit or in a fruit salad. This is especially true in Africa, so...who knows. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯  

In my grocery store, they're in the vegetable section, next to the [tomatoes]({% link _items/tomato.md %}), not the in fruit section, so I'm inclined to think my intuition is correct. However there are frozen avocado cubes by the frozen fruit as well. That seems quite out of place to me, but I can't speak for everyone. I'm not sure enough to be dogmatic on this issue either way.

The Supreme Court of the United States has offhandedly referred to avocados as fruit. This is persuasive, but not legally-binding. Also, even if it was, the Supreme Court doesn't decide the culinary definitions. They just try to understand them themselves, as well as considering policy implications.

Regardless of how you feel on the issue, as long as you don't say that they are fruits *because* of the botanical definition then I'll be happy. Feel free to <a href="mailto:mminer237@gmail.com">contact me</a> and let me know your thoughts though!
