Avocados are definitely fruits botanically. They are the ripened ovaries of the avocado tree and contain seeds. Interestingly, they are technically a <a href="{% link _types/berry.html %}">berry</a> instead of a <a href="{% link _types/drupe.html %}">drupe</a> because there is a *very* thin endocarp (third layer of fruit) around the stone.

Culinarily, they're...well...I'm honestly not sure. I would personally think of them more as a vegetable because they're not really sweet and they're more substantive. But apparently some people do eat them as a fruit or in a fruit salad, especially in Africa, so...who knows. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯  

In my grocery store, they're in the vegetable section, next to the [tomatoes]({% link _items/tomato.md %}), not the in fruit section, so I'm inclined to think my intuition is correct.

Regardless of how you feel on the issue, as long as you don't say that they are fruits because of the botanical definition then I'll be happy. Feel free to <a href="mailto:mminer237@gmail.com">contact me</a> and let me know your thoughts though!

The Supreme Court has offhandedly referred to avocados as fruit. This is persuasive, but not legally-binding. Also, the Supreme Court doesn't decide the culinary definitions.
