title: Avocado
botanically: berry
---
Avocados are definitely fruits botanically. They are the ripened ovaries of the avocado tree and contain seeds. Interestingly, they are technically a <a href="{% link _types/berry.html %}">berry</a> instead of a <a href="{% link _types/drupe.html %}">drupe</a> because there is a *very* thin endocarp (third layer of fruit) around the stone.

Culinarily, they're...well...I'm honestly not sure. I would personally think of them more as a vegetable because they're not really sweet and they're more substantive. But apparently some people do eat them as a fruit or in a fruit salad, especially in Africa, so...who knows. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ As long as you don't say that they are fruits because of the botanical definition I'll be happy.
