Cashews are a common nut eaten around the world. Although they grow on trees, they are not [botanical nuts]({% link _types/nut.html %}#botanically). They grow as [drupes]({% link _types/drupe.html %}). The edible cashew "nut" is actually a [seed]({% link _types/seed.html %}) which grows inside a couple layers of irritating and toxic shells which must first be removed.

Nevertheless, cashews are definitely eaten as nuts and practically indistinguishable therefrom after processing.

To make things more confusing however, attached to the cashew fruit is a [cashew apple]({% link _items/cashew-apple.md %}), which is culinarily treated as a fruit, yet actually does not contain the cashew nut/seed, and therefor isn't a botanical fruit at all!
