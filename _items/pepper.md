Pepper plants are an assortment of plants in the <span lang="la">Capsicum</span> genus which produce colorful fruits which are typically spicy. The peppers themselves are usually small, long, and either red, green, or yellow, but some are a medium size and/or roundish. While they are the fruits of the pepper plants and may externally appear to be culinary fruits, no pepper is used as a fruit. They are typically used for their spiciness, either cut up as a [vegetable]({% link _types/vegetable.html %}) or ground up as a [spice]({% link _types/spice.html %}).

While a few cultivars are not spicy, they still have a grassy, slightly bitter flavor. Even so-called "sweet peppers" are not sweet and would not be eaten raw like a fruit. Even though they are botanically berries, peppers are not berries—or any kind of fruit—culinarily. They are usually vegetables.
