Limes are classic fruits. They are often added to drinks for flavoring. [Although they are possibly the least sweet fruit]({% link _pages/sugar-content-table.html %}), they are *very* sour. They are green, but it is a colorful, light, distinctive, fruity green; and they look just like the rest of the [citrus fruits]({% link _types/hesperidium.html %}). Clearly the lime not a vegetable.
