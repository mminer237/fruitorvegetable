Pumpkins are admittedly closer than most. They are botanically a type of [berry]({% link _types/berry.html %}) called a "[pepo]({% link _types/pepo.html %})" due to their seed-bearing fleshiness and hard outer rinds. Their culinary classification requires a bit more discussion however.

Pumpkins satisfy many of the requirements of being a [culinary fruit]({% link _types/fruit.html %}). They are colorful, kind of sweet, and *they are made into pies*. When was the last time you had pumpkin outside of dessert? I don't remember ever having it in another way.

Yet, uh, it is a vegetableâ€”no doubt about it. This kind of makes sense as other squashes are eaten more normally as vegetables. Also, many people do eat pumpkins in savory dishes. I assume non-pie uses were more common in the past when its categorization was set as well. In addition, it is basically never eaten raw, which is much more befitting of a vegetable than a fruit.
