Dent corn is the [corn]({% link _items/corn.md %}) the corn that you see growing everywhere in the Midwest. It is used for *tons* of things. The most common use by far is cattle feed, but a significant portion of it is eaten by humans as well. There are so many things made from dent corn: cornbread, corndogs, corn syrup, corn chips, corn tortillas, grits, arepas, mush, nachos, hushpuppies, etc. And they're all delicious, except grits. That's just corn sand. Also, we make ethanol out of corn to power our cars.

What is it? Well, each individual kernel is its own fruit, the cob is very nearly a separate fruit, and dent corn is a grain. This fits since it's dried and ground up, often into flour.

Dent corn's graininess contrasts with [sweet corn]({% link _items/sweet-corn.md %})'s vegetabliness.
