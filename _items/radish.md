Radishes are the main roots of radish plants that people eat. I guess they're kind of roundish usually, but they're not [fruits]({% link _types/fruit.html %}) at all. Something has to be a fruit botanically for it to be one culinarily, and radishes don't contain seeds. Plus, like, you eat them with a regular vegetable salad, not with a fruit salad.
