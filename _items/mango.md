Mangoes are a tropical fruit grown around the world. Botanically they are a type of fruit called a [drupe]({% link _types/drupe.html %}) because they have a stone/pit.

Culinarily, they are also quite obviously a fruit. [They're one of the sweetest fruits]({% link _pages/sugar-content-table.html %}) and usually eaten raw. They're often eaten in dessert items like smoothies, pies, ice creams, and cakes. Occasionally mangoes are cooked into other things or added to a salsa, but they definitely function as a fruit in these dishes, adding a sweet contrast.
