Ber are small orangish [drupes]({% link _types/drupe.html %}) common in India. The trees grow quickly and easily and produce thousands of ber each year, so ber have spread quite rapidly around the Indian Ocean.

Ber are soft and juicy, with a sweet and sour taste. As noted, they grow on trees and are not durable. They are readily eaten raw or juiced. They are clearly [fruits]({% link _types/fruit.html %}).
