Cornâ€”what a plant. Each individual kernel is its own fruit, the cob is very nearly a separate fruit, some types are vegetables, **and** corn is generally a grain. It truly is marvelous. It is the most-produced crop on earth. People eat it raw, cooked, creamed, baked, ground-up, popped, as syrup, and in desserts, we use it to create ethanol for our cars, and cattle eat as much corn as humanity several times over.

I may have been a little misleading with that last part though. All the corn that you eat whole is going to be [sweet corn]({% link _items/sweet-corn.md %}), which *is* a type of corn which is eaten as a vegetable but which is only a very, very small percentage of our overall corn production. There are several other types of corn, but the main one grown is [dent corn]({% link _items/dent-corn.md %}). This is the vast majority of the corn produced, and is mostly used for cattle feed, but still makes up the great majority of corn consumed by humans as well. Dent corn is a grain.
