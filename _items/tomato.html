Ah, tomatoes. [This is the most asked-about plant by a large margin.](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&q=is%20corn%20a%20fruit%20or%20a%20vegetable,is%20a%20tomato%20a%20fruit%20or%20a%20vegetable,is%20a%20pumpkin%20a%20fruit%20or%20a%20vegetable,is%20a%20cucumber%20a%20fruit%20or%20a%20vegetable,is%20an%20avocado%20a%20fruit%20or%20a%20vegetable) It seems everyone is confused about whether a tomato is a fruit or a vegetable.
Intuitively, you would think that it is a vegetable. It's not that sweet. It doesn't grow on a tree. You put it in a regular salad, not a fruit salad. Doesn't that make it a vegetable? *Yes, it does.*
"But wait," you say, "I've heard that it's technically a fruit." This is also true. A tomato is both a fruit *and* a vegetable.
