Pears are fruits. Specifically, they are [pomes]({% link _types/pome.html %}). To be honest, they're pretty similar to [apples]({% link _items/apple.md %}), which are the most stereotypical fruits possible. I'm not sure why anyone would think a pear is a [vegetable]({% link _types/vegetable.html %}) unless they don't know what a vegetable is.
