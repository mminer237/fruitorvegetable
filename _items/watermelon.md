Watermelons are obviously fruits, not [vegetables]({% link _types/vegetable.html %}). Although they grow close to the ground, they are very sweet and very, very juicy. [They're possibly the juiciest fruit.]({% link _pages/water-content-table.html %}) They're so juicy that they're named "watermelons". They're always eaten raw, ideally outside. People also attempt to flavor candy after watermelons.

Botanically, watermelons a type of fruit called a "[berry]({% link _types/berry.html %}#botanically)". In a culinary sense, they are obviously not [berries]({% link _types/berry.html %}#culinarily) though. Berries are small fruits usually eaten whole. Watermelons are probably the biggest fruit most people eat. (Maybe competing with [pumpkins]({% link _items/pumpkin.md %})) Watermelons also have a thick rind you have to cut through a knife, which no culinary berry has.
