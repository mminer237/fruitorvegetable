Watermelons are obviously fruits, not [vegetables]({% link _types/vegetable.html %}). Although they grow close to the ground, they are very sweet and very juicy. They're so juicy that they're named "watermelons". They're always eaten raw, ideally outside. People also attempt to flavor candy after watermelons.

Botanically, watermelons a type of fruit called a "[berry]({% link _types/berry.html %}#botanically)". In a culinary sense, they are obviously not [berries]({% link _types/berry.html %}#culinarily) though. Berries are small fruits usually eaten whole. Watermelons are probably the biggest fruit most people eat. (Maybe competing with [pumpkins]({% link _items/pumpkin.md %})) Watermelons also have a thick rind you have to cut through a knife, which no culinary berry has.
