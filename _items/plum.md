Plums are historically one of the most common fruits eaten around the world. Although less common today, they are still a familiar fruit to most people.

They're obviously a [fruit]({% link _types/fruit.html %}), not a [vegetable]({% link _types/vegetable.html %}). They're sweet and maybe a little sour. They grow on trees and have a short shelf life. They're eaten raw, dried into plums, or made into fruit preserves.

Plums are botanically [drupes]({% link _types/drupe.html %}), meaning they have a hard pit in the middle of them. [While this shouldn't matter to you,]({% link _pages/you-dont-have-to-care-about-botanical-definitions.html %}) it may come as a surprise since many plums in America are pitless, meaning they don't have drupes' distinguishing stone in the middle.
