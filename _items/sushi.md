title: Sushi
---
Sushi is a food comprising many ingredients. It definitely contains [rice]({% link _items/rice.md %}), which is a [grain]({% link _types/grain.html %}). Usually it also contains seafood and sometimes various fruits or vegetables. Sea creatures are not vegetables. The typical makizushi type is wrapped in seaweed, which would be a vegetable.

Some of the ingredients are fruits and vegetables; some are not. However, even if everything in a piece of sushi was a fruit or a vegetable, sushi itself never would be. It is a combination of foods. It can never be a single fruit or vegetable itself. There is no plant that produces whole sushi naturally, so it is neither a fruit or vegetable.
