Eggplants, or aubergines for the Europeans, are the colorful fruits of the plant of the same names. They are large, purple, and egg-shaped—hence the name. Botanically, they are berries because they are fleshy and contain seeds but not pits.

For normal, culinary purposes, they are vegetables. Even if [purple is a fruit]({% link _items/purple.md %}), eggplants are not. Their color does not change their taste. Their flavor is not sweet at all, and the raw texture is quite spongy. As a result, they are never eaten raw. Instead, they are sliced and cooked in savory dishes, often as a substitute for meat. [Eggplant parmesan](https://asimplepalate.com/blog/classic-eggplant-parmesan/) is surely the most popular dish using it in the West, but it is even more popularly eaten in Asia in dishes such as [<span lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">yúxiāng-qiézi</span>](https://www.chinasichuanfood.com/yu-xiang-qie-zi-sichuan-eggplant/#recipe). This is practically the epitome of a vegetable.
