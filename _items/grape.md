Grapes are fruits by both definitions. While most grapes we eat now have been bred to not have seeds, they still come from the ovaries and are botanically fruits. They are obviously culinarily fruits, as they are [super sweet]({% link _pages/sugar-content-table.html %}) and delicious.

Interestingly, they are one of the clearest examples of botanical berries, having a simple fleshy structure from one ovary which contains seeds. Yet, few would typically consider them to be berries in the normal sense of the word. Why? I have no idea, to be honest. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è If I had to guess, I would say because of how important they have been historically for winemaking, but I'm literally just making that up on the fly.
