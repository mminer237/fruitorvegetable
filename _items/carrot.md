Carrots are the main roots of carrot plants that people eat. Although sometimes they are put in delicious cakes, they are not [fruits]({% link _types/fruit.html %}). Something has to botanically be a fruit for it to be one culinarily. Also, carrot cake is basically the only time their consumption resembles fruit's. You don't dip fruit in ranch dip hopefully.
