<p>Achenes are a type of <a href="{% link _types/fruit.html %}">fruits</a> where the fruit is dry and just barely bigger than the seed. As they don't have any juice, they are never eaten as a fruit culinarily.</p>
<p>They are very, very similar to <a href="{% link _types/cypsela.html %}">cypselae</a>, as they are both dry, indehiscent fruits with a single seed linked to the fruit wall only by the funicle. However achenes are simple fruits and derive from the superior ovaries. Cypselae instead originate from inferior ovaries.</p>
