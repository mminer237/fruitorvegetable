<p>Vegetables are a culinary class of food. Unlike "<a href="{% link _types/fruit.html %}">fruit</a>," "vegetable" has no botanical meaning. It is a purely culinary term. Most dictionaries define it something like "a part of a plant used for food," which isn't very helpful. Obviously <a href="{% link _items/apple.md %}">apples</a>, <a href="{% link _items/orange.md %}">oranges</a>, and <a href="{% link _items/grape.md %}">grapes</a> are not vegetables.</p>
<p>What is and isn't a vegetable is a rather vague question. It's basically any plant that isn't a fruit. This makes it easy to include essentially any part of a plant that is eaten other than the fruit, but that's not all vegetables. <a href="{% link _pages/how-can-something-be-a-fruit-and-a-vegetable.html %}">Some things are botanical fruits but still vegetables,</a> and saying what is and what isn't a culinary fruit is just the flip-side of the same question.</p>
<p>It's hard to pin a firm definition on a purely cultural construct, but some of the common identifying traits of vegetables are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Typically, vegetables are much less sweet and juicy than fruits.</li>
	<li>They are typically eaten as part of a main course with other vegetables and/or meat.</li>
	<li>They're often less colorful and are most commonly just green.</li>
	<li>They often need to be cooked before eating.</li>
	<li>They often grow close to or under the ground.</li>
	<li>They typically grow on annual plants.</li>
</ul>
<p>This site can hopefully help with drawing that line between fruit and vegetable, although I'll be honest and admit that there are some things like <a href="{% link _items/avocado.md %}">avocados</a> that I'm not even sure about. I always welcome <a href="https://matthewminer.name/contact">feedback</a>.</p>
