<p>Vegetables are a culinary class of food. Unlike "<a href="{% link _types/fruit.html %}">fruit</a>," "vegetable" has no botanical meaning. It is a purely culinary term. Most dictionaries define it something like "a part of a plant used for food," which isn't very helpful. Obviously <a href="{% link _items/apple.md %}">apples</a>, <a href="{% link _items/orange.md %}">oranges</a>, and <a href="{% link _items/grape.md %}">grapes</a> are not vegetables.</p>
<p>What is and isn't a vegetable is a rather vague question. It's basically any plant that isn't a fruit, but saying what is and what isn't a culinary fruit is just the flip-side of the same question.</p>
<p>Typically, vegetables are much less sweet than fruits. They are typically eaten as part of a main course with other vegetables and/or meat. They're often less colorful and are most commonly just green.</p>
<p>This site can hopefully help with drawing that line between fruit and vegetable, although I'll be honest and admit that there are some things like <a href="{% link _items/avocado.md %}">avocados</a> that I'm not even sure about. I always welcome <a href="https://matthewminer.name/contact">feedback</a>.</p>
