<p>Taproots are the big, central roots that some plants have. They are key parts of such plants as all other roots needed for nutrients will grow out of the taproot.</p>
<p>Sometimes these will also be designed to be storage organs for the plant to store nutrients in as well. In such cases, these are often eaten like with <a href="{% link _items/carrot.md %}">carrots</a> and <a href="{% link _items/radish.md %}">radishes</a>.</p>
<p>Culinarily, taproots are always vegetables. They never have seeds or ovaries in them and are therefore not even botanically fruits.</p>
