<p>Sometimes you just aren't sure what something is. This usually doesn't happen botanically as scientists dedicate their lives to research plants, including obscure classification specificities.</p>
<p>Culinarily though, there is no strict definition of what is a <a href="{% link _types/fruit.html %}">fruit</a> and what is a <a href="{% link _types/vegetable.html %}">vegetable</a>. People can sometimes disagree and cause no widespread accord to be reached. In such cases, all you can do is understand how the words "<a href="{% link _types/fruit.html %}">fruit</a>" and "<a href="{% link _types/vegetable.html %}">vegetable</a>" are used and then reach your own conclusion about which you think is more fitting.</p>
