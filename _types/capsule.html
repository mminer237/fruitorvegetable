<p>A capsule is a type of <a href="{% link _types/fruit.html %}#botanically">botanical fruit</a>. The name is very fitting as they are like capsules which split open to spread the seeds therein. It is reminiscent of a <a href="{% link _types/caryopsis.html %}">caryopsis</a> in that it comprises multiple locules. Some capsules superficially look like a caryopsis when cut horizontally due to the locules' arrangement. However, each locule is very similar to a <a href="{% link _types/legume.html %}">legume</a>. They typically dry out, split open, and spread the seeds inside.</p>
<p>The term does not have a separate culinary meaning. Although, it does have a generic meaning of just a small container.</p>
<p>Many capsules are not eaten. Some like <a href="{% link _items/durian.md %}">durians</a> are eaten as fruits before they're entirely dry. Many others are eaten as beans, and therefore <a href="{% link _types/vegetable.html %}">vegetables</a>, again very similarly to legumes.</p>
