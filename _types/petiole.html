<p>A petiole is a type of stalk that connects <a href="{% link _types/leaf.html %}">leaves</a> on a plant to a central stem. Like, the stem typically grows up, petioles grow out of them, and have leaves directly attached. They're the little "stems" on leaves. (Though they're actually stalks, not stems.)</p>
<p>The petioles we eat are going to be large and crunchy. Given they are not botanically fruits though, they will not be fruits culinarily.</p>
