<p>Cypselae are a type of <a href="{% link _types/fruit.html %}">fruits</a> where the fruit is dry and just barely bigger than the seed. As they don't have any juice, they are never eaten as a fruit culinarily.</p>
<p>They are very, very similar to <a href="{% link _types/achene.html %}">achenes</a>, as they are both dry, indehiscent fruits with a single seed linked to the fruit wall only by the funicle. However cypselae derive from the superior ovaries, and achenes instead originate from inferior ovaries.</p>
