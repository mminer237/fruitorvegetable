<p>An inflorescence is a group of <a href="{% link _types/flower.html %}">flowers</a> all arranged together on a stem. This can be a series of flowers growing periodically along a tall plant or it can a cluster of flowers all bunched together at the top of a stem. This latter type are also commonly called flower heads. Often we will even colloquially call such structures flowers themselves, however such inflorescences technically consist of many flowers, often hundreds.</p>
