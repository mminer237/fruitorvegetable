<p>Aggregate fruits are a category of <a href="{% link _types/fruit.html %}">fruits</a> where the fruit derives from multiple ovaries. This is very similar to <a href="{% link _types/multiple-fruit.html %}">multiple fruits</a>, but with aggregate fruits all of the ovaries come from the same flower.</p>
