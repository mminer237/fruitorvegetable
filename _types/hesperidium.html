<p>Hesperidia are a type of <a href="{% link _types/fruit.html %}">fruit</a>, specifically a type of <a href="{% link _types/berry.html %}">berry</a>. As you can hopefully guess from the name, it is just a technical, botanical classification.</p>
<p>Hesperidia are basically just citrus fruits like <a href="{% link _items/orange.md %}">oranges</a> and <a href="{% link _items/lemon.md %}">lemons</a>. A hesperidium is distinguished from other fruits by its thick spongy rind and by the fact that the different sections of its ovary are filled with juice sacs. I believe these different sections are caused by several ovaries joining together into one early in the fruit's development.</p>
