<p>Botanically, a nut is a type of <a href="{% link _types/fruit.html %}">fruit</a> with a single seed and a hard shell around it that does not split open. Practically, these are going to also be dry on the inside and not have a fleshy bit, like you expect fruit to have.</p>
<p>You would probably consider all botanical nuts to be nuts, but many things you consider to be nuts food-wise are not nuts botanically. Often, these culinary nuts are actually seeds.</p>

<p>"Culinarily" means in a food context. When you eat nuts, you don't really concern yourself with how your nuts reproduce or whether they used to be in a larger fruit. You kind of just think of smallish dry, crunchy things. Things that are "nutty."</p>
<p>Since that is what society has agreed nuts to be, that really is all you should have to concern yourself with. The botanical definition does not have relevance to you. A nut is a nut.</p>
