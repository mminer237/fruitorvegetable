<p>Accessory fruits are a category of <a href="{% link _types/fruit.html %}">fruits</a> where some of the flesh comes from something other than the ovary. Technically, some accessory fruits, such as the [cashew apple]({% link _items/cashew-apple.md %}), are not fruits at all since the accessory "fruit" does not actually contain a seed.</p>
