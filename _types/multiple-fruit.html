<p>Multiple fruits are a category of <a href="{% link _types/fruit.html %}">fruits</a> where the fruit derives from multiple fruits all merging together. This is very similar to <a href="{% link _types/aggregate-fruit.html %">aggregate fruits</a>, but multiple fruits actually consist of wholly separate fruits from different fruits growing together.</p>
<p>Multiple fruits highlight the lack of usefulness of botanical definitions for what you call "fruit." Very few people would consider <a href="{% link _items/pineapple.md %}">pinapples</a> or <a href="{% link _items/fig.md %}">figs</a> to consist of separate fruits.</p>
