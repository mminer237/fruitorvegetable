<p>Berries are a type of <a href="{% link _types/fruit.html %}">fruit</a>. Like "fruit," "berry" has two fairly disparate meanings depending on whether you are talking the context of botany or in the context of food.</p>

	<p>An indehiscent fruit derived from a single ovary and having the whole wall fleshy, such as a grape or tomato.</p>

<p>In the study of plants, the word "berry" means a botanical fruit that is all fleshy, was formed from a single ovary, and doesn't split open to release the seeds. Simple examples are <a href="{% link _items/grape.md %}">grapes</a> and <a href="{% link _items/tomato.md %}">tomato</a>.</p>
<p>If you're not botanist, you really don't care about this definition.</p>

<blockquote cite="https://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=berry">
	<p>A small, juicy, fleshy fruit, such as a blackberry or raspberry, regardless of its botanical structure.</p>

<p>This is what we would usually think of as a berry. They're small fleshy fruits which are usually going to be eaten whole. One would rarely eat a single berry.</p>
<p>There is surprisingly little overlap with the botanical definition. <a href="{% link _items/blueberry.md %}">Blueberries</a> are about the only thing I can think of that's both.</p>
<p>In practice, culinary berries are super easy to identify. We literally stick "berry" at the end of every one's name.</p>
