<p>Caryopses are, botanically, <a href="{% link _types/fruit.html %}">fruits</a> where the fruit part fuses with the outside of the seed. They also dry out. These are usually picked, dried, and eaten as "<a href="{% link _types/grain.html %}">grains</a>." The two terms have different definitions, but mostly overlap. Caryopses are the "seeds" from grasses. Grains are dried seeds typically eaten as staple foods.</p>
