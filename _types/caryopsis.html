<p>Caryopses are, botanically, <a href="{% link _types/fruit.html %}">fruits</a> where the fruit part fuses with the outside of the seed. They also dry out. If this sounds confusing, that's fine. You probably know them better by their more culinary name of " <a href="{% link _types/grain.html %}">grains</a>." They're the "seeds" from grasses.</p>
