<p>A legume is a type of <a href="{% link _types/fruit.html %}#botanically">botanical fruit</a> consisting of a long pod which splits open along two seams and the (typically multiple) seeds inside. The term does not have much of a separate culinary meaning, but it's often used to only refer to beans and peas. The botanical classification also includes other "fruits" such as <a href="{% link _items/peanut.md %}">peanuts</a>, although this may be a bit of a confusing use of the word for the average person.</p>
<p>Many legumes are eaten as <a href="{% link _types/vegetable.html %}">vegetables</a>, although legumes do have their own special culinary category of "<a href="{% link _types/pulse.html %}">pulses</a>" for beans, lentils, and certain other legumes that are dried before cooking and eating them.</p>
