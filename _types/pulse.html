<p>"Pulse" is a culinary term to refer the dried seeds inside <a href="{% link _types/legume.html %}">legumes</a> that are eaten as grains. If such legumes are not eaten dried but instead fresh, like peas and beans often are, then they are not pulses but instead <a href="{% link _types/vegetable.html %}">vegetables</a>, since they are no longer being eaten as grains.</p>
