<p>Some <a href="{% link _types/taproot.html %}">taproots</a> are so big and focused on storage that they are called "tuberous roots." They look like and are sometimes called "<a href="{% link _types/tuber.html %}">tubers</a>," but they are not true tubers since they are still roots of the plants and not part of their stems.</p>
